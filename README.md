Abstract-ify!
=============

Apply a filter to your image to make it look like abstract art.

## Background
“I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.” - Thomas A. Edison

After experimenting with [this code](https://github.com/jefarrell/Topography.py), It failed to produce the kind of maps I had first envisioned, but the output had an artistic look. I decided to experiment further and turn that idea into something presentable.

## Usage
<pre><code>python topo.py yourImage.jpg</code></pre>

## Further Ideas
  * Implement multiple filters
  * Use randomness to make the output a little different each time
  * Host this as a Flask web app

## Example
Original:

![clouds image](/clouds.jpg)

Abstractified:
